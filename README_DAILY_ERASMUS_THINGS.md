I've followed the weekly meeting and met all the Bioinformatics Section of the SLU. It was a bit stressful, but in the end I was really happy to have met the whole section and I was not stress at all. I was running everywhere to get an access card and SLU e-mail. Unfortunately, I didn't get any of those. Also, I introduce myself in the epigenetics mechanism.

Iâ€™ve learn more things about Epigenetics, like Epigenome, DNA methylation, CG (or CpG) site.
Also what epigenetics affects to, and what affects epigenetics.
And mainly, getting an temporary access card & trying to get a SLU e-mail. 
Spoiler : Didn't get the SLU e-mail.

I went deeper in the CpG site thing. I discovered that there's three differents categories of epigenetics ; Direct, Within-Indivudal and Across-Generations. Currently learning histone and chromatin mechanism in epigenetics.
No SLU e-mail yet :'(

Today is the day, I finally got my acces card and my SLU e-mail ! Youuhouu ! At 10 in the morning, I've followed a workshop about the management of the VH building (I think haha). After that, there was a presentation on "Good Research Practice". This was a bit difficult to understand every sentence sometimes, but in the end I can say that I have understood almost all the idea.
