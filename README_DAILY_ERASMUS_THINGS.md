I've followed the weekly meeting and met all the Bioinformatics Section of the SLU. It was a bit stressful, but in the end I was really happy to have met the whole section and I was not stress at all. I was running everywhere to get an access card and SLU e-mail. Unfortunately, I didn't get any of those. Also, I started to understand the epigenetics mechanism.

07/02/2023

Iâ€™ve learn more things about Epigenetics, like Epigenome, DNA methylation, CG (or CpG) site.
Also what epigenetics affects to, and what affects epigenetics.
And mainly, getting an temporary access card & trying to get a SLU e-mail. 
Spoiler : Didn't get the SLU e-mail.

I went deeper in the CpG site thing. I discovered that there's three differents categories of epigenetics ; Direct, Within-Indivudal and Across-Generations. Currently learning histone and chromatin mechanism in epigenetics.
No SLU e-mail yet :'(

Today is the day, I finally got my acces card and my SLU e-mail ! Youuhouu ! At 10 in the morning, I've followed a workshop about the management of the VH building (I think haha). After that, there was a presentation on "Good Research Practice". This was a bit difficult to understand every sentence sometimes, but in the end I can say that I have understood almost all the ideas.

10/02/2023

I have sent my first e-mail to Michael ! I have been deeper in Histone & Chromatin functioning. 
I visited the server room with Renaud, kinda cool !

13/02/2023

Another monday meeting with the whole Bioinformatics section ! I'm now in contact to Michael !! I'll continue reading articles about epigenetics to really get used to it.

14/02/2023

For today, I've mainly focus my day to go deeper (again) in the DNA methylation thing, Bisulfite sequencing and Epigenetics (Environment on Epigenetics).
I adjust my quotes too.

15/02/2023

I've read more articles, mainly in the library that Michael send me. After the day, we had a dinner with all the bioinformatics section, it's was really fun !

16/02/2023

For today, I'e mainly focus my day on the DNA methylation and Cassava. Doing some coding in python, to remember how it works haha. I also had a meeting with Michael to introduce me to him, to explain my background and to just met us. I'm fully motivate !!

17/02/2023

I've read some articles about pan-transcriptomic analysis due to the Micheal e-mail and finished my python code who imitate the bisulfite sequencing. But I don't really know where to go. 

20/02/2023

I've followed another Moday Meeting with the whole Bioinformatic Section. It is always interesting to hear people's week ! I have a bit more information about my internship. For today, I've read Transcriptomic articles to get used to it, like Epigenetic.

21/02/2023

I have continued reading Transcriptomic articles, about the mechanism, on what it is correlated with Epigenetics and the two methods that are used for Transcriptomic (Microarry and RNA-Seq)

22/02/2023

Today, I continued reading Transcriptomic articles, I discovered that there's some step to follow to make a good Pan-transcriptomic analysis.

23/02/2023

Today, I had a meeting with the Epicass team, they give me information of what I'll do for my internship. I'll do an assembly of RNA-Seq data, and analyse it. The RNA data, is from RNA-Seq, Illumina (PE).
I'll use Trinity programm.

24/02/2023

For today, I've read some articles about De novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity. And trying to get used with the programm. I'm waiting for Michael that copy the cassava data on planetsmasher.
