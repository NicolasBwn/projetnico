Iâ€™ve learn more things about Epigenetics, like Epigenome, DNA methylation, CG (or CpG) site.
Also what epigenetics affects to, and what affects epigenetics.
And mainly, getting an access card & trying to get a SLU e-mail.

I went deeper in the CpG site thing. I discovered that there's three differents categories of epigenetics ; Direct, Within-Indivudal and Across-Generations. Currently learning histone and chromatin mechanism in epigenetics.
