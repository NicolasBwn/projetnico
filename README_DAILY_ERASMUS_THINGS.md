I've followed the weekly meeting and met all the Bioinformatics Section of the SLU. It was a bit stressful, but in the end I was really happy to have met the whole section and I was not stress at all. I was running everywhere to get an access card and SLU e-mail. Unfortunately, I didn't get any of those. Also, I started to understand the epigenetics mechanism.

07/02/2023

I’ve learn more things about Epigenetics, like Epigenome, DNA methylation, CG (or CpG) site.
Also what epigenetics affects to, and what affects epigenetics.
And mainly, getting an temporary access card & trying to get a SLU e-mail. 
Spoiler : Didn't get the SLU e-mail.

08/02/2023

I went deeper in the CpG site thing. I discovered that there's three differents categories of epigenetics ; Direct, Within-Indivudal and Across-Generations. Currently learning histone and chromatin mechanism in epigenetics.
No SLU e-mail yet :'(


09/02/2023

Today is the day, I finally got my acces card and my SLU e-mail ! Youuhouu ! At 10 in the morning, I've followed a workshop about the management of the VH building (I think haha). After that, there was a presentation on "Good Research Practice". This was a bit difficult to understand every sentence sometimes, but in the end I can say that I have understood almost all the ideas.

10/02/2023

I have sent my first e-mail to Michael ! I have been deeper in Histone & Chromatin functioning. 
I visited the server room with Renaud, kinda cool !

13/02/2023

Another monday meeting with the whole Bioinformatics section ! I'm now in contact to Michael !! I'll continue reading articles about epigenetics to really get used to it.

14/02/2023

For today, I've mainly focus my day to go deeper (again) in the DNA methylation thing, Bisulfite sequencing and Epigenetics (Environment on Epigenetics).
I adjust my quotes too.

15/02/2023

I've read more articles, mainly in the library that Michael send me. After the day, we had a dinner with all the bioinformatics section, it's was really fun !

16/02/2023

For today, I'e mainly focus my day on the DNA methylation and Cassava. Doing some coding in python, to remember how it works haha. I also had a meeting with Michael to introduce me to him, to explain my background and to just met us. I'm fully motivate !!

17/02/2023

I've read some articles about pan-transcriptomic analysis due to the Micheal e-mail and finished my python code who imitate the bisulfite sequencing. But I don't really know where to go. 

20/02/2023

I've followed another Moday Meeting with the whole Bioinformatic Section. It is always interesting to hear people's week ! I have a bit more information about my internship. For today, I've read Transcriptomic articles to get used to it, like Epigenetic.

21/02/2023

I have continued reading Transcriptomic articles, about the mechanism, on what it is correlated with Epigenetics and the two methods that are used for Transcriptomic (Microarry and RNA-Seq)

22/02/2023

Today, I continued reading Transcriptomic articles, I discovered that there's some step to follow to make a good Pan-transcriptomic analysis.

23/02/2023

Today, I had a meeting with the Epicass team, they give me information of what I'll do for my internship. I'll do an assembly of RNA-Seq data, and analyse it. The RNA data, is from RNA-Seq, Illumina (PE).
I'll use Trinity programm.

24/02/2023

For today, I've read some articles about De novo transcriptome assembly using Trinity. And trying to get used with the programm. I'm waiting for Michael that copy the cassava data on planetsmasher.

27/02/2023

I had the monday meeting, I didn't say all the things I wanted to say, I was stressed but I don't know why ? I continued reading articles using Trinity for an assembly, and fastP.

28/02/2023

I received the short description of Andreas about the two analysis I'll work on. Michael just copied the CassavaFlowering data on planetsmasher, that's super good !! Here I'm making workflow about the two analysis I'll do. The base re the same for the both (QC), for Trinity I think a got a good one, just need to perfect it but mostly good. But for Haplotype analysis, I'm not used to that so I need to read articles and to understand well the purpose. But I'm really motivated so it'll be okayy.

01/03/2023

I started making the workflow, I almost finished the Pan-Transcriptomics one. And I ask Michael for some advices

02/03/2023

I finished the Pan-Transcriptomics workflow, I submit it to Michael and wait for his judgement. I also started the expression analysis one.
I started making my presentation for my internship purpose.

03/02/2023

I have some trouble about making the mapping workflow one, I'm not really used to it, I dont feel well with it, I submited it to Michael to see what he'll say.
I also continue making my presentation about my internship purpose for my school

BONUS : 04/03/2023 -> We went to Stockholm with Thomas and Baptiste, it was super nice !!

06/03/2023

I've follow another monday meeting, we were not a lot for this one, and I almost say my previous week without "bugging" haha. Next time I'll do it !! And I also had my presentation about my internship purpose, It was terribly bad, I dispointed so many people, I went too far in the explaination, explain wrong things and didn't explain thing that were important to explain. So it was a mess. BUT I'm not discourage at all, I know I'll do a better thing next time, and I'll make people proud.

07/03/2023

I made a meeting with the whole EpiCass team to discuss about the approach of my analysis on 09/03. I also go deeper in the programs I'll use for the pan-transcriptomics analysis. I'm more confident with the programs, but I need to learn more thing to really get used of it, moslty about the expression analysis one.

08/03/2023

I've run my first jobs on planetsmasher!! Waoouuh! It's a bit different from running jobs from your own laptop, there's some steps to do before doing things. But it's cool I'm glad running some programs. I also finished the workflow because tomorrow we'll have a meeting about it, so I need to be prepared.

09/03/2023

13/03/2023->17/03/2023
- At the beginning of the week I started Trinity program on the first clone of the Cassava flowering data (DSC120).
- He’s still in queue in the server jobs.
- I also started to write my internship report.
- I discovered that in the fasqc report there were a high duplication level in some replicates, I tried to understand why, I learnt that’s normal and expected.
